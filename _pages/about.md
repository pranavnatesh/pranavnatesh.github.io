Aspiring engineer specializing in electrical engineering and aerospace technology. Actively contributing as an Engineering Lead for [Aero Team Eindhoven](https://aeroteameindhoven.nl), focusing on cutting-edge battery-powered fixed-wing drones. Pursuing a BSc in Electrical Engineering (Automotive Technology) at [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://tue.nl). I'm particularly interested in Electric Propulsion, integrating the fields of Control Systems, Electromechanics, and Power Electronics to (literally) drive sustainable change in both the automotive and aerospace industries.

Beyond academics, I enjoy puzzle-solving, unraveling complex problems in engineering projects, and exploring languages â€” my favorite pastimes for mental stimulation and creativity.

I'd be happy to answer any questions. Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/pranav-natesh).
