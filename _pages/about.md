Aspiring engineer specializing in electrical engineering and machine learning. Recently graduated with a BSc in Electrical Engineering (Automotive Technology) from [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://tue.nl) and will pursue an MSc in Electrical Engineering there. Formerly contributed as an Engineer for [Aero Team Eindhoven](https://aeroteameindhoven.nl), focusing on cutting-edge battery-powered fixed-wing drones. I am passionate about Control Systems, Electromechanics, and Machine Learning, with a particular interest in applying these fields to Electric Propulsion to (literally) drive sustainable change in the automotive industry.

Beyond academics, I enjoy puzzle-solving, learning new skills by completing projects, and exploring languages â€” my favorite pastimes for mental stimulation and creativity.
